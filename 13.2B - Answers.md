# Answer Key: PixelRNN & PixelCNN Deep Dive

### Question 1
**Correct Answer:** To decompose the joint distribution of pixels into a product of conditional distributions.

**Justification:**
> "We can factorize the joint distribution as the product of conditionals, where we define some ordering over the pixels." 

---

### Question 2
**Correct Answer:** False

**Justification:**
> "This can be really slow, unlike convolution layers it's not paralyzed." 

---

### Question 3
**Correct Answer:** Sequential generation leading to slow sampling processes.

**Justification:**
> "This can be really slow, unlike convolution layers it's not paralyzed." 

---

### Question 4
**Correct Answer:** PixelCNN employs masked convolutions to capture dependencies, while PixelRNN uses recurrent neural networks.

**Justification:**
> "We can train this using similar methods as the language models, for example, a recurrent neural network." 

---

### Question 5
**Correct Answer:** False

**Justification:**
> "We can then estimate this conditional distribution as a neural network." 

---

### Question 6
**Correct Answer:** It requires sequential processing, making it less efficient.

**Justification:**
> "This can be really slow, unlike convolution layers it's not paralyzed." 

---

### Question 7
**Correct Answer:** It uses actual image pixels to guide the model's predictions during training.

**Justification:**
> "We can train this using similar methods as the language models, for example, a recurrent neural network." 

---

### Question 8
**Correct Answer:** PixelCNN allows for parallel processing during training, improving efficiency.

**Justification:**
> "This can be really slow, unlike convolution layers it's not paralyzed." 

---

### Question 9
**Correct Answer:** True

**Justification:**
> "We can factorize the joint distribution as the product of conditionals, where we define some ordering over the pixels." 

---

### Question 10
**Correct Answer:** It enables the decomposition of the joint pixel distribution into a sequence of conditional probabilities.

**Justification:**
> "We can factorize the joint distribution as the product of conditionals, where we define some ordering over the pixels."
