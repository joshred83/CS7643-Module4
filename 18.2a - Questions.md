# Quiz: Semi-Supervised Learning

---

### Question 1 (True/False)  
Semi-Supervised Learning assumes a large amount of labeled data and a small amount of unlabeled data.

- True  
- False  

---

### Question 2 (Multiple Choice)  
What is the central goal of Semi-Supervised Learning?

- To replace supervised learning using adversarial training  
- To match supervised learning performance with fewer labels by leveraging unlabeled data  
- To eliminate the need for data augmentation  
- To fine-tune on labeled data only  

---

### Question 3 (Multiple Select)  
Which of the following are elements of the FixMatch algorithm?

- Strong and weak data augmentations  
- Use of pseudo-labels derived from confident predictions  
- Multiple neural networks trained independently  
- Cross-entropy loss applied to strongly augmented examples  

---

### Question 4 (Multiple Choice)  
Why is the use of a confidence threshold important in FixMatch?

- It ensures that the network learns invariant features across domains  
- It filters out incorrect labels to maintain training quality  
- It balances class frequencies in the dataset  
- It speeds up backpropagation  

---

### Question 5 (True/False)  
FixMatch trains a supervised model first and then uses it to label data in a separate second stage.

- True  
- False  

---

### Question 6 (Multiple Select)  
Which optimization strategies or tricks are used to make FixMatch effective?

- Cosine learning rate scheduler  
- Exponential moving average of weights  
- Zero-shot prompting for unlabeled data  
- Large batch sizes for unlabeled data  

---

### Question 7 (Multiple Choice)  
What is one challenge of setting the confidence threshold too high in pseudo-labeling?

- It may generate pseudo-labels for the wrong class  
- It may cause memory leaks during training  
- It may prevent many unlabeled examples from being used  
- It could destabilize the optimizer's momentum  

---

### Question 8 (True/False)  
Label Propagation assumes that unlabeled examples close in feature space to labeled ones should receive similar labels.

- True  
- False  

---

### Question 9 (Multiple Select)  
Which challenges or limitations of semi-supervised learning are mentioned in the lecture?

- Need for large unlabeled datasets  
- Difficulty in tuning hyperparameters  
- Inability to scale beyond small academic datasets  
- Poor generalization to real-world noisy datasets  

---

### Question 10 (Multiple Choice)  
What does the success of FixMatch highlight about modern semi-supervised learning?

- The need for large ensembles of models  
- The importance of training exclusively on unlabeled data  
- That simple strategies like augmentation and thresholding can outperform more complex methods  
- That label propagation has become the dominant strategy
