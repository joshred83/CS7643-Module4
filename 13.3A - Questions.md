# Quiz: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

### Question 1 (True/False)
GANs learn an explicit probability density function over the input data \( p(x) \).

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

---

### Question 2 (Multiple Choice)
What is the role of the discriminator in a GAN?

- [ ] To directly generate synthetic images
- [ ] To encode images for classification
- [ ] To distinguish between real and generated samples
- [ ] To minimize reconstruction loss

---

### Question 3 (Multiple Select)
Which of the following challenges are associated with training GANs?

- [ ] Require labeled data
- [ ] Instability due to adversarial training
- [ ] Mode collapse
- [ ] Non-convex optimization difficulties

---

### Question 4 (True/False)
The generator in a GAN is updated using the same part of the loss function that affects the discriminator.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

---

### Question 5 (Multiple Choice)
What is typically used as input to the generator during training?

- [ ] A real image
- [ ] A label vector
- [ ] A vector sampled from a Gaussian distribution
- [ ] A sequence of pixels

---

### Question 6 (Multiple Select)
Which of the following are methods used to stabilize GAN training?

- [ ] Batch normalization
- [ ] Removing fully connected layers
- [ ] Freezing the discriminator weights
- [ ] Using LeakyReLU in the discriminator

---

### Question 7 (Multiple Choice)
What is the core principle behind the generator's objective in GANs?

- [ ] To minimize pixel-wise reconstruction error
- [ ] To classify images accurately
- [ ] To fool the discriminator into thinking generated images are real
- [ ] To compute gradients on real data only

---

### Question 8 (True/False)
After training a GAN, only the generator is typically used to sample new data.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

---

### Question 9 (Multiple Choice)
Which of the following is a symptom of mode collapse in GANs?

- [ ] The generator produces high diversity in outputs
- [ ] The discriminator fails to distinguish real and fake samples
- [ ] The generator produces a small set of nearly identical outputs
- [ ] The generator becomes unable to learn from gradients

---

What are some real-world applications or extensions of GANs mentioned in the lecture?

- [ ] Video generation
- [ ] Audio synthesis
- [ ] Domain adaptation using adversarial losses
- [ ] Direct supervised classification with explicit \( p(x) \)
