# Quiz: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

### Question 1 (True/False)



VAEs are generative models that maintain an explicit density model of the data.

- [ ] A. True

- [ ] B. False

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** A
**Explanation:**

### Question 2 (Multi-Select)



Which of the following accurately describe the role and properties of the Variational Lower Bound (ELBO) in VAEs? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] A. It addresses the intractability of the marginal likelihood

- [ ] B. It allows for an indirect optimization of the log-likelihood

- [ ] C. It imposes a regularization effect on the latent space

- [ ] D. It enables direct sampling from the true posterior

- [ ] E. It provides a tractable objective function for optimization

- [ ] F. It completely eliminates the need for approximating the posterior

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** A, B, C, E
**Explanation:**  
The ELBO is used because computing the marginal likelihood directly is intractable, and it provides a lower bound that can be optimized.  
> "Now, if we could directly maximize this, then we're essentially maximizing the likelihood... But we can't really do this. The integral doesn't allow us because it's intractable. Instead, what we're going to do is maximize what's called a variational lower bound..."
> "The KL divergence term in the ELBO acts as a regularizer that constrains the approximate posterior to be close to the prior."

- [ ] D. Variational objective

- [ ] E. Contrastive loss

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** A, C, D
**Explanation:**  
VAEs consist of an encoder and decoder, trained using a variational lower bound (ELBO).

### Question 4 (Multi-Select)



Which of the following accurately describe the purpose and effects of the KL divergence term in the VAE loss function? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] A. It penalizes deviation of the learned distribution from the prior

- [ ] B. It acts as a regularizer on the latent space

- [ ] C. It ensures the latent space has a well-defined probability density

- [ ] D. It measures how well images are reconstructed

- [ ] E. It encourages a smooth, continuous latent space

- [ ] F. It forces the encoder to learn a specific fixed mapping

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** A, B, C, E
**Explanation:**  
The KL term ensures that the learned latent distribution does not deviate too far from the prior (typically Gaussian), which regularizes the latent space.  
> "The second part of the term here, is a KL divergence between Q of z given x and p of z... And so we're taking the KL divergence between the Z's that our encoder network outputs and the prior..."
> "This regularization ensures that the latent space has meaningful properties that allow for sampling and interpolation."

### Question 5 (True/False)



The reparameterization trick enables backpropagation through the sampling process in VAEs.

- [ ] A. True

- [ ] B. False

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** A
**Explanation:**  
The reparameterization trick allows the model to be differentiable despite sampling.  
> "The problem is you can't actually back propagate through sampling... So there's something called a reparameterization trick... which allows you to do the sampling."

### Question 6 (Multi-Select)



Which of the following accurately describe the properties and outputs of the decoder in a VAE? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] A. The decoder outputs parameters of a Gaussian distribution

- [ ] B. The decoder maps from latent space back to data space

- [ ] C. The decoder models the conditional probability p(x|z)

- [ ] D. The decoder uses a one-hot encoding for all outputs

- [ ] E. The decoder typically includes mean and variance parameters

- [ ] F. The decoder's parameters are learned through gradient descent

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** A, B, C, E, F
**Explanation:**  
The decoder outputs the mean and (diagonal) covariance of a Gaussian from which samples are drawn, mapping from latent to data space.  
> "This decoder models p of x given z... it will be a Gaussian distribution parameter. Here specifically, it will be mu and Sigma."
> "The decoder network transforms the latent representation back into the original data space and learns the parameters of the output distribution."

### Question 7 (Multi-Select)



Which of the following are accurate statements about the relationship between the true posterior p(z|x) and the approximate posterior q(z|x) in VAEs? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] A. The true posterior p(z|x) cannot be computed directly due to intractability

- [ ] B. The approximate posterior q(z|x) is typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution

- [ ] C. The encoder network directly outputs parameters for q(z|x)

- [ ] D. The KL divergence term minimizes the difference between q(z|x) and p(z)

- [ ] E. The true posterior would require marginalization over all possible data points

- [ ] F. The approximation error between q(z|x) and p(z|x) can be quantified

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D, E
**Explanation:**  
The true posterior is intractable, requiring an approximate posterior that is typically modeled as a Gaussian.  
> "The right hand side is actually intractable. We can't compute this term. And so what we're going to do is... ignore it."
> "What we're doing is using Q of z given x to approximate P of z given x."
> "The encoder network produces parameters for the approximate posterior, typically modeled as a diagonal Gaussian."

### Question 9 (True/False)



The decoder in a VAE directly generates the reconstructed image without involving any probability distribution.

- [ ] A. True

- [ ] B. False

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** B
**Explanation:**

**Correct Answers:** A, B, C, D, F
**Explanation:**  
VAEs often produce blurrier outputs due to the probabilistic nature of their objective function and struggle with various limitations.  
> "VAEs can suffer from blurry outputs."
> "The Gaussian assumption in both the prior and approximate posterior can limit the expressivity of the model."
> "VAEs optimize for reconstruction quality which can come at the expense of sample quality."
