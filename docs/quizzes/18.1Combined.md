**Correct Answers:** [Need to manually determine]
**Correct Answers:** [Need to manually determine]
**Correct Answers:** ✅ Generate from confident predictions, ✅ Iteratively expand training set, ✅ Leverage unlabeled data structure, ✅ Implement self-training, ✅ Benefit from distribution information  
**Explanation:**  
Pseudo-labeling serves multiple important purposes in semi-supervised learning.  
> "We can then take that and convert it into a pseudo label... and put them into the training set and retrain."
> "This allows the model to iteratively improve by incorporating its own confident predictions into training."
> "The unlabeled data provides information about the input distribution that can help the model generalize better."

### Question 5 (True/False)  


Self-supervised learning uses human-annotated labels to guide feature learning.

- [ ] A. True

- [ ] B. False

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** B
**Explanation:**  
Self-supervised learning does not use human-annotated labels but instead creates tasks from unlabeled data.  
> "In self-supervised learning... we assume we have no labels. All we have are unlabeled examples..."

### Question 7 (Multi-Select)  


Which of the following accurately describe "surrogate tasks" in self-supervised learning? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] A. They are designed to force networks to learn useful representations, though the tasks themselves may be artificial

- [ ] B. They can involve predicting properties of data that are automatically generated (like rotations)

- [ ] C. They create supervision signals from the data itself without human annotation

- [ ] D. They are often designed based on domain knowledge about what makes good features for downstream tasks

- [ ] E. They require human labels to define the learning objectives

- [ ] F. They can involve reconstructing part of the input from another part

**Correct Answers:** [Need to manually determine]
**Correct Answers:** ✅ Designed to force learning useful representations, ✅ Can involve predicting generated properties, ✅ Create supervision without human annotation, ✅ Often designed with domain knowledge, ✅ Can involve reconstruction tasks  
**Explanation:**  
Surrogate tasks have several key characteristics in self-supervised learning.  
> "...we'll rotate an image... and try to make the neural network predict which rotations we applied... we actually don't care about it... but we're trying to force the neural network to learn..."
> "These tasks generate their own supervision signal from the data structure itself."
> "Examples include predicting image rotations, solving jigsaw puzzles from image patches, and inpainting missing regions."
