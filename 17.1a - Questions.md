# Quiz: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

---

### Question 1 (True/False)
In reinforcement learning, agents are trained with labeled data to learn a direct mapping from inputs to outputs.

- True  
- False

---

### Question 2 (Multiple Choice)
Which of the following best defines reinforcement learning?

- Learning from fully labeled datasets  
- Making sequential decisions in an environment with correct labels  
- Sequential decision-making in an environment with evaluative feedback  
- Performing classification on time-series data  

---

### Question 3 (Multiple Select)
Which of the following are key characteristics or challenges of reinforcement learning?

- The agent receives a label for the correct action at each step  
- The reward signal may be delayed  
- The policy affects future data distribution  
- Every state-action pair is observed multiple times  

---

### Question 4 (Multiple Choice)
In the RL interaction loop, what does the agent receive from the environment after taking an action?

- A set of labels and loss gradients  
- The next state only  
- The next observation and a reward  
- Only the scalar reward  

---

### Question 5 (True/False)
The data distribution that a reinforcement learning agent sees remains stationary throughout training.

- True  
- False

---

### Question 6 (Multiple Choice)
Which of the following best describes "evaluative feedback" in reinforcement learning?

- Feedback containing the exact correct action for each state  
- Feedback in the form of a reward based only on the action taken  
- Predefined training loss for model optimization  
- Instructional cues based on expert demonstrations  

---

### Question 7 (Multiple Select)
Which are common application domains for reinforcement learning as discussed in the lecture?

- Image segmentation  
- Robotic control  
- Atari game playing  
- Board games like Go  

---

### Question 8 (True/False)
The RL agent receives rewards for all actions, including those it did not take.

- True  
- False

---

### Question 9 (Multiple Choice)
Why is reinforcement learning in real-world robotic settings particularly difficult?

- All states are visited equally often  
- The environment is static and predictable  
- Some states may be seen only once  
- Actions never influence future observations  

---

### Question 10 (Multiple Choice)
What is the agentâ€™s goal in reinforcement learning?

- Minimize classification error  
- Memorize sequences of states  
- Maximize long-term accumulated reward  
- Discover
