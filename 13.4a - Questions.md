# Quiz: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

---

### Question 1 (True/False)
VAEs are generative models that maintain an explicit density model of the data.

- True
- False

---

### Question 2 (Multiple Choice)
Which problem does the Variational Lower Bound (ELBO) primarily solve in VAEs?

- Inability to reconstruct images  
- Overfitting to noise in latent space  
- Intractability of the marginal likelihood  
- Ambiguity of decoder outputs

---

### Question 3 (Multiple Select)
Which components are part of the VAE architecture?

- Encoder  
- Discriminator  
- Decoder  
- Variational objective  
- Contrastive loss  

---

### Question 4 (Multiple Choice)
What is the purpose of the KL divergence term in the VAE loss?

- Encourage outputs to be binary  
- Measure how well images are reconstructed  
- Penalize deviation from the prior  
- Ensure decoder uses ReLU activation  

---

### Question 5 (True/False)
The reparameterization trick enables backpropagation through the sampling process in VAEs.

- True  
- False

---

### Question 6 (Multiple Choice)
What form does the output of the decoder take in a typical VAE?

- A binary vector  
- A one-hot encoding  
- Parameters of a Gaussian distribution  
- A hard classification decision  

---

### Question 7 (Multiple Choice)
What is the main reason the true posterior \( p(z|x) \) is replaced with an approximate posterior \( q(z|x) \) in VAEs?

- The posterior \( p(z|x) \) is uniform and uninformative  
- The posterior cannot be computed directly  
- The posterior overfits on training data  
- The posterior makes encoder training unstable  

---

### Question 8 (Multiple Select)
Which benefits or capabilities are associated with the latent space of a trained VAE?

- Smooth interpolation between data points  
- High-resolution image generation  
- Disentanglement of semantic attributes  
- Use in downstream tasks  
- Fully deterministic reconstruction

---

### Question 9 (True/False)
The decoder in a VAE directly generates the reconstructed image without involving any probability distribution.

- True  
- False

---

### Question 10 (Multiple Choice)
Which of the following is a recognized weakness of VAEs compared to GANs?

- VAEs cannot generate samples  
- VAEs lack latent variable representations  
- VAEs produce sharper images  
- VAE samples tend to be blurrier
