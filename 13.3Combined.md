**Correct Answers:** 
**Justification:**  
> "The key idea of generative adversarial networks is to have another network that distinguishes between real and generated or fake images."
</details>

### Question 3 (Multiple Select)

Which of the following challenges are associated with training GANs?

- [ ] A. Require labeled data

- [ ] B. Instability due to adversarial training

- [ ] C. Mode collapse

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** 
**Justification:**  
> "The complex dynamics of learning will actually turn out to be quite difficult to train."  
> "You have all sorts of strange dynamics that can occur between the generator and discriminator."  
> "There's something called mode collapse where you can't capture all the modes of the distribution."  
> "We're using very deep complex neural networks that are non convex."
</details>

### Question 4 (True/False)

The generator in a GAN is updated using the same part of the loss function that affects the discriminator.

- [ ] A. True

- [ ] B. False

**Correct Answers:** 
**Justification:**  
> "Note that for the generator, only one part of this objective function is valid... gradients for the discriminator comes from both."

### Question 5 (Multiple Choice)


### Question 5 (Multi-Select)

Which of the following can be used as inputs and characteristics of the generator component in GANs? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] A. A vector sampled from a Gaussian distribution

- [ ] B. Random noise from a uniform distribution

- [ ] C. A real image

- [ ] D. A label vector for conditional generation

- [ ] E. The generator maps from a simple distribution to a complex one

- [ ] F. The generator requires pre-training on autoencoder objectives

- [ ] G. Batch normalization

- [ ] H. Removing fully connected layers

- [ ] undefined. Freezing the discriminator weights

- [ ] undefined. Using LeakyReLU in the discriminator

**Correct Answers:** 
**Justification:**  
> "We're going to use a simple idea of first sampling from a simple distribution, say a Gaussian... then feed it through a neural network."
> "The generator transforms points from a simple noise distribution into the complex data distribution through a neural network mapping."
> "In conditional GANs, we can provide additional information like class labels to guide the generation process."
</details>

### Question 7 (Multi-Select)

Which of the following accurately describe the objectives and optimization dynamics of the generator in a GAN? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] A. To fool the discriminator into thinking generated images are real

- [ ] B. To minimize the likelihood that the discriminator correctly identifies fake samples

- [ ] C. To minimize pixel-wise reconstruction error

- [ ] D. To maximize the probability that generated samples are classified as real

- [ ] E. To learn the mapping from latent space to data space

- [ ] F. To compute gradients on real data only

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** 
**Justification:**  
> "That means that it taking fake data and giving it a probability of being real as 1, which is what the generator wants because it wants to fool the discriminator."
> "The generator is trying to maximize the log probability of the discriminator making a mistake."
> "The generator learns the mapping from the latent space to a particular data distribution."
</details>

### Question 8 (True/False)

After training a GAN, only the generator is typically used to sample new data.

- [ ] A. True

- [ ] B. False

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** 
**Justification:**  
> "At the end of the training, we'll have an implicit generator model... We actually don't need the discriminator for this process, we can just throw it away."
</details>

### Question 9 (Multi-Select)

Which of the following accurately describe mode collapse and related challenges in GAN training? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] A. The generator produces a small set of nearly identical outputs

- [ ] B. The generator fails to capture the full diversity of the training distribution

- [ ] C. The discriminator fails to distinguish real and fake samples

- [ ] D. The generator learns to generate only the most common patterns in the data

- [ ] E. Mode collapse can be diagnosed by observing low diversity in generated samples

- [ ] F. Mode collapse is unrelated to the minimax optimization process

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** 
**Justification:**  
> "There's something called mode collapse... you're not truly sampling from the distribution, you're just outputting the samples that you already have."
> "The generator simply isn't able to represent all modes of the data distribution, leading to a lack of diversity in the generated samples."
</details>

### Question 10 (Multiple Select)

What are some real-world applications or extensions of GANs mentioned in the lecture?

- [ ] A. Video generation

- [ ] B. Audio synthesis

- [ ] C. Domain adaptation using adversarial losses

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers:** 
**Justification:**  
> "These days other adaptations have been developed to produce audio waveforms..."  
> "You can then take as input a 10 second footage of you... generate an entire video of you dancing..."  
> "The notion of adversarial losses... have been used successfully."
